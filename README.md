# UDACITY_DS_Project1_Blog

My educational blog which contains anayses based on results achieved in iroject1.ipyn

The project uses datasets from this location https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data

The following Airbnb activity is included in this Seattle dataset:

Listings, including full descriptions and average review score.
Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments.
Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day.

The purpose of that project is to analyse thee topics:

1. How do prices influence amount of bookings?

2. In which areas are the most accomodations located? (neighbourhood)

3. Which accomodations have the best review_scores and how do they go together with bookings?
