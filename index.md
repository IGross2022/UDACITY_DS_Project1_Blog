
The project analyzes the Airbnb activities in Seattle dataset based on following datasets:

- **Listings**, including full descriptions and average review score
- **Reviews**, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- **Calendar**, including listing id and the price and availability for that day

These data can be downloaded from located on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle/data

The purpose of that project is to analyse thee topics:

1. How do prices influence amount of bookings?
2. In which areas are the most accomodations located? (neighbourhood)
3. Which accomodations have the best review scores and how do they go together with bookings?


# 1. How do prices influence amount of bookings?

The fist step of the project helps to understand the customer group and to find out in which appartements are customers most interested in.
What is attracting them most: the cheaper prices or the quality of the aparments (eventhough the prices might be a bit higher)?

It has been found out that the most attracting appartements cost between 50 and 200 Dollar which do not belong to the exclusive group of apparments.
They are not on the cheapest level, but belong rather to the lower price appartments. That means that people paying for 50-200 Dollar appartments 
are the main group of customers.

Starting with 200 Dollar upwards the number of bookings decreases with each step up of price and become very rare for the most expensive ones.

It was interesting to realize that the cheapest accommodations (up to 50 Dollar) are though also frequently used, however not as often as of main customer group.
